durable, resumable, asynchronous file transfer
==============================================

++statsMgr().stats(fd|id).stat;

--

- rx to fill bufs
- header inline w/data, padded
- tail writes padded by reader/sender
    - rx can issue mixed inner/tail writes w/o leaking data from other files rx'd into megabuf
- megabuf from pool
    - rx fills
    - rx walks through, creating & enqueuing subbufs
    - subbufs are megabuf markers + shared ptr to megabuf
    - all subbufs freed, megabuf returns to pool
- rx to open files on demand instead of holding all descs open for duration of xfer
- rx to track completion for each file, truncate at end & close
